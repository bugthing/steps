Steps
=====

Ruby2 - Rails4 - EmberJS - Thats right, I'm trying out some new
stuff with a toy project called **Steps**.

What is it?
-----------

Makes it easy to build a flow chart and execute it.

Have a try
-----------

It is just a normal Rails app, so give it a spin like so:
    git clone <this repo>

    bundle

    rails s

The plan
--------

*  Carefully craft the backend to be a simple relational, well
   tested set of objects.

*  Expose the backend via a RESTful JSON API.

*  Build an EmberJS front end UI - with good JS tests

*  Build an EmberJS admin UI - with good JS tests
